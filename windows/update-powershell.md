# Update PowerShell

PowerShell 5.1 unfortunately does not come pre-packaged with the full set of
features in Windows 11. As such, you may need to update the various aspects
listed below based on your needs.

## Update help files

If you wish to do scripting in PowerShell, it will be useful to have the latest
version of help files available on your computer. Run the following command to
install the latest version of help files.

```powershell
Update-Help -Verbose -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
