# Welcome to 0xNixxy Tech Tips

Welcome to my personal repository of technical tips, an opinionated collection
of practical and time-saving solutions that I gathered over time. These notes
serve as my go-to reference for topics on system maintenance, software
development and cybersecurity. I hope that others facing similar technical
topics will find this collection helpful.

I used [Github-flavoured Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github)
to write documents in this repository due to the simplicity to render visual
guides, such as notes and warnings, without additional deployment overheads.
