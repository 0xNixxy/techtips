# Welcome to 0xNixxy Tech Tips

This repository contains a personal collection of technical snippets that I
collected over time to save time. I hope that it will also help you save time
when faced with similar technical topics.

I used [Github-flavoured Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github)
to write documents in this repository due to the simplicity to render visual
guides, such as notes and warnings, without additional deployment overheads.
